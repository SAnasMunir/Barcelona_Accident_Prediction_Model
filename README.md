# Barcelona Accident Prediction Model
Predictive Analysis and Data Visualization of accident data in Barcelona using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

This project makes use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to analyze and predict accident trends in Barcelona using a dataset that includes fields such as district, street, time, month, injury severity, number of victims, and vehicles involved.


**Project Goals:**

- Conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize accident distribution by time, day of the week, and district.

- Develop a predictive model using regression to estimate the number of victims per accident based on features like hour, day, month, district name, and vehicles involved.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning data, handling missing values, and selecting relevant features for prediction.
- **Visualization:** Data distribution and correlation heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Modeling:** Regression-based prediction for the number of victims, providing insights into high-risk factors.

This project provides a foundation for developing data-driven solutions to improve urban safety and informs potential policy-making.
